### Steps I should follow in development procedure:
1. Have HLD and LLD
2. Have CI Pipeline for SAST and security analysis (using tools like Semgrep)
3. For CD Pipeline find a place to store artifacts (like s3) for free.
4. Implement CI linter
4. Decide a Roadmap with tentative time every step will take, publish the roadmap in README.md
5. Start with Code.
6. Mention development steps in README.md
